# COVID19_Detector

In this notebook we are using X-rays scans images to detect COVID19 and pulmonary diseases. We use Pytorch to apply mutiple transformations to our images tensors and feed them to a residual neural network (ResNet18).

We use the kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/download to train and evaluate the model.

Metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, confusion matrix are also presented.
